    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
        Homer Jay Simpson was born on May 12, 1956, to Abraham Simpson II and Mona Olsen. He was raised on the Simpson
        family farm until they were forced to move out due to Homer jumping out of a hay bale and scaring the cows into
        giving sour milk, causing the bank to foreclose it. At some point in his childhood, Homer began drinking alcohol
        like his father and accidentally caused a traffic jam in a Playskool car. According to a family tree designed by
        the creator of the show, Matt Groening, Mr. Burns, his boss, is a distant relative of him.
    </p>

    <p>
        His father forced him to attend Camp See-A-Tree, where he went on a date with Marge Bouvier from Camp
        Land-A-Man; unfortunately, he lied about his name and sustained an injury while Marge changed her appearance.
        Homer then accidentally stumbled into Camp Flab-Away and escaped too late to meet with her again, something that
        left him as heartbroken as Marge.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Homer was around twelve, his mother went into hiding following a run-in with the law and Abe faked her
        death[43]; before that, she took Homer and Abe to Woodstock, where he ended up briefly adopting the hippie
        lifestyle, much to Abe's disapproval. Homer, along with Lenny, Carl, and Moe, went to a deep gorge to swim but
        the water was drained. When investigating why the lake was reduced to a muddy pit, he stumbled upon a
        decomposing corpse inside a nearby pipe, greatly traumatizing him.
    </p>

    <p>
        When he was 15, Homer participated in a drinking contest by lying that he was 22. However, he became so
        intoxicated he ended up drinking a whole beer keg used to fill the other contestants' cups. Eventually he was so
        hungover he missed almost an entire month of school.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before beginning high school, Homer convinced Barney to have a beer can while his father was asleep. Barney, an
        aspiring student preparing for Harvard, was annoyed and reluctantly drank it. However, he took to alcohol so
        quickly he nigh-permanently became a worse drunken wreck than Homer and presumably failed his SAT tests.
    </p>

    <p>
        Homer attended Springfield High School, falling in love with an older and unrecognizable Marge after she
        ultimately rejected Artie Ziff. After finishing (but not graduating from) high school, Marge and Homer
        bought an apartment at Springfield Place together. During this time, Marge got a letter accepting her into a
        college. To pay for her tuition, Abe gave his son a job at Simpson Laser Tag. The couple broke up for some time
        after Homer started a grunge band called Sadgasm. Marge later realized that she really loved Homer and went back
        to him.[46] At some point between finishing high school and marrying Marge, Homer briefly served in the U.S.
        Army but never saw combat. Due to a clerical error, he was discharged early, and years later, after a disastrous
        dinner party with his old sergeant, Homer was forced to complete his tour of duty.

                In his early 20s, Homer was working at Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre, turning the crank that
                spun
                the
                windmill. After a night out with Marge, he learned that he'd prematurely impregnated her with their
                first
                child,
                who they decided to name "Bart" if it was a boy. He got married to Marge at Shotgun Pete's, a small
                wedding
                chapel across the state line. They spent their wedding reception alone at a truck stop before ending up
                at
                the
                Bouvier house.

        After failing to get a job at the power plant, Homer eventually left Marge to support his family. He went to
        work at the restaurant Gulp 'n' Blow until Marge convinced him to return home with her. As a result, Homer
        confronted Charles Montgomery Burns and secured a job at the plant. Two years after Bart was born, Marge
        became pregnant again with Lisa shortly before they bought their first house. Homer's second leap to stardom
        was his success as the lead singer and songwriter for the barbershop quartet The Be Sharps, even winning a
        Grammy. During his time with the group, Homer was frequently absent which put stress on his marriage. After the
        group broke up due to creative differences, Homer went back to Springfield.
    </p>
    <p>
        When in his 30s, Homer prepared a budget so that he could work at his dream job, a pin monkey at the Bowlarama
        Bowling Alley, owned by Barney's uncle Al Gumble. The budget included buying regular toilet paper and that only
        one of the kids could go to college. Unfortunately for Homer, Marge became pregnant once more with Maggie around
        this time, and he reluctantly went back to the nuclear plant in order to support his family. Since then,
        Homer has started many jobs, but in the end, he always comes back to his job at the Nuclear Plant.
