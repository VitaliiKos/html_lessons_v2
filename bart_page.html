    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
        Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson (born April 1 or February 23) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood,
        disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of
        Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after
        discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical
        Hit",
        "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the
        Simpson
        Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series, he has
        discovered a new comet which was named after him, and he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse
        Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bart is a self-proclaimed underachiever and prankster who is constantly in detention who in addition to his
        behavior is easily distracted. His penchant for shocking people began before he was born, Bart "mooned" Dr.
        Hibbert while he performed a sonogram on Marge when she was pregnant with him, and moments after being born, he
        set Homer's tie-on fire, starting his life as a prankster (Marge saying that he could not have done it on
        purpose because he was only ten minutes old). Bart's first words were "Ay Caramba" after he walked in on
        Homer and Marge at a bad time.

                When Lisa was born, Bart got jealous of all the attention Lisa was getting sick and tried to make
                himself
                the
                center of attention. Bart eventually couldn’t take it anymore and told Lisa he was running away. Then,
                Lisa
                said
                her first word: “Bart!” Bart heard Lisa and realized how much she loved him, and realized he had to
                stay.

    <p>
        Bart's interests include Krusty the Clown (he is "Krusty Buddy" number 16302), reading comic books (especially
        Radioactive Man), watching TV (especially The Krusty the Clown Show and The Itchy & Scratchy Show), terrorizing
        Lisa, playing video games, helping Lisa solve various problems (e.g. reuniting Krusty with his estranged
        Father), and pulling off various pranks, (such as mooning unsuspecting people, prank calling Moe at his tavern,
        and his patented spitting off an overpass). Bart also sprays graffiti under the alias 'El Barto', and regularly
        frequents the Kwik-E-Mart (for bubble gum and Squishees) and The Android's Dungeon. Yuma Hickman moved to
        Springfield when Marge was pregnant with Bart.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bart hinted that his favorite movies are Jaws and the Star Wars trilogy. His best friend is Milhouse Van
        Houten.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bart is the most misunderstood of the family (After Maggie, who currently can only speak a few words),
        constantly frustrated by the narrow-minded people of Springfield, who judge him merely by his thoughts and
        actions.
    </p>
    <h3>Date of birth inconsistency</h3>
    <p>
        In "My Sister, My Sitter”, it is stated that Lisa is 2 years and 38 days younger than Bart. In "Mr. Lisa's Opus"
        and on the show's official Instagram account, Lisa's birthday is revealed to be on May 9, putting Bart's
        birthday on April 1. However, in "Simpsorama", Bart states that his birthday is on February 23rd.
