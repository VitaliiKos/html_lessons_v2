    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
        Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two
        tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.
    </p>
    <p>
        In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called
        Lil'
        Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement
        of
        the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her
        family.
        In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing
        saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's
        popularity
        is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses
        on
        her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an
        IQ
        of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to those who she deems lower than her or
        even
        above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the
        smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things
        through.

                Lisa is quite eclectic in her knowledge and is notably more concerned with world affairs and problems
                than her cohorts, which has led her to alienate herself from her peers. Lisa also deeply values her
                integrity, sometimes at the expense of others' needs and happiness, as demonstrated when she cheats on a
                test in The Wind in the Willows to attain her highest grade of A-plus, but later admits her dishonesty
                to an unreceptive Principal Skinner despite the fact that such a grade allowed the school to gain the
                extra income it 'desperately' needs. (She later regrades the test as an F.) Also, Lisa was willing
                to tell everyone about Bart faking his own kidnapping to go to a rap concert (despite the fact that
                absolutely everybody involved in the case was better off) just because she could. Despite her intellect,
                Lisa has received detention, like her brother Bart, quite a number of times, often because of her
                rebellious and sometimes bitter attitude and antisocial behavior that is capable of deeply embarrassing
                authority figures. Although her rebellion against social norms is usually constructive, Lisa can be
                crazy, cruel, and rebellious at times. When she believes herself to be right, she won't admit that
                others could be as well and will often force her beliefs onto people. Notably, her increasing sense of
                moral righteousness regarding her vegetarianism leads her to proselytize, culminating in her spiteful
                disruption of a "meat-based" barbecue prepared by Homer (an act she comes to rue). At times, Lisa
                appears to resist certain situations merely for the sake of resisting them, not because of any genuine
                ideological opposition. She appears to enjoy breaking the norm for its own sake; in one time, she
                triumphantly declares that she, a girl, would like to join the football team. When it is revealed that
                there are already girls on the team, she declares her distaste for a sport that would use a pig's skin
                to make its ball. When it is revealed that the ball is actually synthetic and the proceeds of buying it
                go in part to charity, she is at a loss for words and runs off visibly upset. She also seems to
                dislike having her intellect challenged, which is evident on occasions such as when she was temporarily
                promoted to the third grade or when Miss Hoover gave her a B+ on her final grade for conduct and
                actually caused her physical harm because of it. Lisa's first word was Bart at two years of age. Despite
                her high IQ, cuteness, and beauty, Lisa does have typical childhood issues, sometimes requiring adult
                intervention. She once tricked Homer into allowing her to ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly
                lost. After his coworkers Lenny and Carl point out that he allowed his daughter to ride a bus by
                herself, Homer comes to her rescue. Lisa has a Jewish imaginary friend named Rachel Cohen who "just
                got into Brandeis University." Even with a high intellect, Lisa displays personality traits typical for
                her age, including obsessing over getting a pony, being addicted to TV, and fighting with Bart. Lisa
                once got addicted to secondhand smoke to maintain an impressive level of ballet competence; Homer tries
                to prevent the addiction unsuccessfully, and in the end, Lisa overcomes the addiction herself through
                means of "Hello Kitty" nicotine patches. She also displays a surprising amount of skill in driving,
                especially for her age, sometimes even taking the wheel whenever Homer ended up distracted from
                driving. In "The Girl Who Slept Too Little", she struggled with nightmares after a cemetery was
                moved next to the Simpsons' house. She overcame her fear after spending a night in the cemetery and
                realized that it was acceptable to suffer from fear despite her intelligence. It was revealed in this
                episode that Lisa largely had to raise herself due to Homer and Marge dealing with Bart's antics thus
                ensuring a lack of nurturing for her. Lisa has been known in earlier seasons to have a bit of a sassy
                attitude. Like Bart and most siblings in families, Lisa has been known to tease Bart herself, examples
                such as crushes Bart has developed, or advice on writing to someone (in this one case, his teacher),
                even just plain sassing him for attention. Deep down inside, Lisa loves her brother deeply.
